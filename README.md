# DSA Notes
After graduating from Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp, I recognized that data structures & algorithms would be a weakness of mine as I entered the job search. Because of this, I immediately enrolled in [Colt Steele's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) to further my learning in this area. At the same time, I also took [Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's Next.js & React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/) because I really wanted to learn Next.js. As a result of these two courses, I created this Next.js application to hold my growing set of DS&A notes, as well as any interesting toy problems I come across.
